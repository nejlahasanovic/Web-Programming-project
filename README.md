## What's NOT Done

**Leagues** and **Results** pages are not implemented because they need real-time data from external APIs and I tried to implement it but i failed miserably (like Football-Data.org or API-Football). This requires:
- Paid API subscriptions
- Live match data
- Complex database setup

I left these out for now I hope that's not a problem, but I'll add them later for production.
